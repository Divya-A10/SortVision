# ✨ Feature Request

## 🎯 Feature Overview

**Feature Title**
Add Sound Effects for Sorting Operations

**Feature Category**

- [x] 🎵 Audio/Accessibility
- [x] 🎨 UI/UX Enhancement

## 🔍 Problem Statement

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
The current sorting animations are purely visual, which may limit engagement and accessibility for users who benefit from auditory feedback. This creates a barrier for users who learn better through audio-visual combinations or have visual impairments.

**User Story**
As a user learning sorting algorithms, I want to hear sound effects during sorting operations so that I can better understand and engage with the visualization process.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Integrate sound effects using the Web Audio API to provide auditory feedback for different sorting operations. This will include:

- Click sounds for comparisons
- Pop sounds for swaps
- Success sound when sorting completes

**Key Features/Requirements:**

- [ ] Sound effect toggle in UI
- [ ] Different sounds for different operations
- [ ] Volume control
- [ ] Mute option

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Sound effects play correctly for each sorting operation
- [ ] Users can toggle sounds on/off
- [ ] Sound effects are not disruptive to the main experience
- [ ] Audio implementation is performant

## 🔄 Alternative Solutions

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Visual feedback alone is helpful, but audio adds a complementary layer of interactivity, especially for users with different learning styles.

**Why is this the best approach?**
Web Audio API provides a native, performant way to implement sound effects without requiring external libraries.

## 🎨 Design & Implementation Ideas

**Technical Considerations:**

- **Frontend**: React components with Web Audio API
- **Dependencies**: None (using native Web Audio API)
- **Performance**: Minimal impact as audio is lightweight
- **Accessibility**: Improves accessibility for users with visual impairments

## 📊 Impact Assessment

**Priority/Importance**

- **Priority**:

  - [x] 🟡 Medium (Important but not urgent)

- **Impact**:
  - [x] 📈 Major (Significantly improves UX)

**Target Audience:**

- [x] 👨‍🎓 Students learning algorithms
- [x] 👩‍🏫 Educators teaching CS
- [x] 👨‍💻 Developers studying algorithms
